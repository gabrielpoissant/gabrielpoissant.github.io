**Goal:**

To answer key business questions by cleaning, processing, and analyzing real-world e-commerce transaction data.

**Data:**

I used a dataset that details e-commerce sales and returns, taken from a UK-based online store which primarily sells gift items to wholesalers. The dates of sales range from 12/01/2009 to 12/09/2010.

| Column    | Description                                   | Example Value |
|--------   |--------                                       |--------|
|Invoice    |Invoice number. Cancellations begin with 'C'|  491633| 
|StockCode  |Code that uniquely identifies product ordered|48195|
|Description|Description of product ordered                 |DOOR MAT GREEN PAISLEY|
|Quantity   |Number of units ordered per transaction        |2|
|InvoiceDate|Date and time of invoice                       |2009-12-11 15:37:00|
|Price      |Per-unit price in sterling                     |6.75|
|Customer ID|Number that uniquely identifies customer       |17958.0|
|Country    |The country the customer ordered from          |United Kingdom|

**Business Questions**

I sought to answer the following critical business questions:
- How has monthly revenue evolved over time?
- Is there evidence of seasonality in sales?
- What is the average order value, and how has it changed?
- What share of revenue comes from repeat customers?
- How concentrated is revenue among customers?
- Which products drive the majority of revenue?
- Which products have disproportionately high return rates?
- How is revenue distributed geographically?
- Are certain markets growing faster than others?
- What percentage of gross revenue is lost to returns?

**Approach**

Analyzing this dataset required several data cleaning steps, and repair before analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**
- **Missing Data** (repaired using other row information)
- **Cleaning** (data types, additional columns, trimming rows)
- **Business Insights**

Missing value analysis before and after processing:
